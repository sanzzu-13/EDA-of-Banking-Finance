## Introduction

In this project, we delve into the banking finance domain using exploratory data analysis techniques. The primary objectives of this analysis include:

- Understanding customer demographics and behavior.
- Examining transaction patterns and volumes.
- Identifying trends and anomalies in financial data.
- Providing insights for business decision-making within the banking sector.

## Data

The dataset used for this analysis comprises anonymized banking finance data. Due to privacy concerns, the dataset cannot be shared publicly. However, the analysis code provided in this repository can be adapted to work with similar banking finance datasets.

## Analysis Overview

The analysis is divided into several key steps:

1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the data, handling missing values, and ensuring data consistency.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizing key features of the dataset to uncover patterns and trends.
3. Statistical Analysis: Conducting statistical tests to validate hypotheses and draw conclusions.
4. Insights and Recommendations: Summarizing findings and proposing actionable insights for stakeholders.

## Folder Structure

- `/data`: Placeholder directory for storing datasets (not included in this repository).
- `/notebooks`: Jupyter notebooks containing the EDA code and analysis results.
- `/images`: Visualizations generated during the analysis.
- `/scripts`: Additional scripts or utilities used in the analysis.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the project.

## Getting Started

To replicate the analysis, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies (see [Dependencies](#dependencies)).
3. Obtain a similar banking finance dataset and place it in the `/data` directory.
4. Run the Jupyter notebooks in the `/notebooks` directory to execute the analysis.
5. Explore the generated visualizations and insights.

## Dependencies

The analysis code is written in Python and requires the following dependencies:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scipy`

You can install these dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scipy
